## Python examples

The PyQt6 example is limited, because it does not handle physical keyboard input. Also, there are many more GUI frameworks for which there is no example. However, this PyQt6 example (combined with the [JavaScript examples](https://github.com/MathKeyboardEngine/MathKeyboardEngine/tree/main/examples)) might provide insight in how to use MathKeyboardEngine in any project.

Feel free to ask questions.
