== Release steps ==

> save and close all open documents except this one.

> verify that the test coverage is 100%:
py -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report term-missing

> verify that the tests pass all versions of Python:
py -m nox

> install if not already done:
py -m pip install wheel
py -m pip install twine

> in setup.py, increment the version="0.1.0-alpha.?", then run:
py setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
py -m twine check dist/*

> upload to PyPi:
py -m twine upload dist/*

== Manually testing the release ==
> create a folder 'Test' and open it in VS Code, then run:
py -m pip install mathkeyboardengine==0.1.0a12 (Change the version number to the latest version. Running this command twice seems necessary sometimes.)

> create a new file `main.py` with the following content:
```
from mathkeyboardengine import concat_latex, LatexConfiguration, Placeholder, TreeNode, KeyboardMemory, get_edit_mode_latex, get_view_mode_latex, LeafNode, BranchingNode, StandardLeafNode, PartOfNumberWithDigits, DecimalSeparatorNode, DigitNode, StandardBranchingNode, AscendingBranchingNode, DescendingBranchingNode, RoundBracketsNode, MatrixNode, move_right, move_down, move_left, move_up, insert, insert_with_encapsulate_current, leave_selection_mode, insert_with_encapsulate_selection, insert_with_encapsulate_selection_and_previous, delete_current, delete_selection, select_left, select_right, in_selection_mode, enter_selection_mode

k = KeyboardMemory()
latexconfiguration = LatexConfiguration()
print(get_edit_mode_latex(k, latexconfiguration))
```
> In the upper-right corner of VS Code, click the play button and verify that the Terminal displays `\blacksquare`. If success, all imports are available as they should.
